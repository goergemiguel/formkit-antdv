# Formkit + Ant Design

This library is an experiment and is in-progress. It combines usage of formkit schema, validation (and other features) but instead renders ant design components.

## TODO:

-   [x] Use schema approach to override formkit component library
-   [x] Add few Ant Design components to custom formkit library
-   [x] Set few examples of basic components
-   [x] Handle two-way binding of components (capture user input, render value)
-   [x] Support ALL Ant Design props in formkit schema
-   [x] Handle custom events of Ant design components
-   [x] Sync formkit validation and ant design component error state, show red borders when validation fails
-   [ ] Continue adding other ant design components to library definition
-   [ ] Try modifying ant design tokens and see if it causes any issues.
-   [ ] More comprehensive form examples
-   [ ] Auto generating documentation from examples
